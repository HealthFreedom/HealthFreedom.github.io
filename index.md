The PennWest Join Student Covid-19 Taskforce is an organization of students attending PennWest campuses with deep concerns about the way coronavirus has been handled by our college administrators. We seek to ensure the interests of students are prioritized in the decisionmaking process and that there is accountability and transparency within the administration. There exists a surfeit of doctors and scientists who, at great cost to their careers, have presented contrary views and evidence regarding many measures institutions have taken, and we believe the evidence these experts present must be examined, even if it contradicts federal agencies or mainstream media. We do not believe the federal government and large pharmaceutical companies are always free from corruption. We believe that student liberties, including bodily autonomy and free speech are threatened, and must be defended.

# Goals

- Demanding accountability and transparency from the PennWest administration's Joint Covid-19 Task Force.
- Evaluating the PennWest administration's response to Covid-19 in the past and, if necessary, into the future, including evaluating negative impacts on students.
- Demanding that treatment recommendations are appropriate for a college demographic.
- Sharing amongst ourselves accurate Covid-19 information, ensuring that the trustworthiness of sources is fully evaluated and conflicts of interest are identified.
- Resisting all mandates and other dictats that infringe on student's bodily autonomy or their other liberties.

# Roadmap

 1. Assemble a Board of Directors of interested students and set up regular meeting times.
 2. Draft and ratify a charter describing how this organization will operate.
 3. Aggregate effective scientific and ethical arguments and evidence to share with members and present to the administration.
 4. Meet with the administraiton to present concerns.
 5. Spread awareness to other students with events, demonstrations, and by distributing information.
