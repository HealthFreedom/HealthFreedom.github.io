title: More Deaths in 2021 than 2020
tags: deaths causes
---

In 2020, approximately 3,358,814 total deaths (828.7 per 100,000) occured according to provisional CDC data.<sub>[1](#references)</sub> In 2021, approximately 3,458,697 total deaths (841.6 per 100,000) occured according to provisional CDC data.<sub>[2](#references)</sub>. The overall death rate per 100,000, therefore, increased by 1.5% from 2020 to 2021. 

This is unexpected for several reasons. The first reason is the phenomenon known as Mortality Displacement, or Harvesting Events. According to Wikipedia,

> Mortality displacement is a phenomenon where a period of excess deaths (i.e., more deaths than expected) is followed by a period of mortality deficit (i.e., fewer deaths than expected).

When a population is exposed to a sudden, new, harsh condition, such as a heat wave or a novel coronavirus, there is a rush of deaths amongst the most vulnerable population, such as the very old or the very sick. These are individuals who might die any time within the next few years but, due to the new environmental condition, all die at once. As a result, there is a large spike of deaths but, after the "harvesting event" occurs, the deaths fall, because much of the vulnerable population has already died so those who would die in the next month or year are not there to do so. 

We can see that a harvesting event likely did occur, according to CDC data, because the death rate in the over 75 population actually did fall in 2021. <sub>[2](#references)</sub>

The extra deaths came from young demographics. While accidents contributed, the major driver of deaths was attributed by the CDC to Covid-19:

Age Group | 2020 Deaths per 100,000 | 2020 Covid Deaths per 100,000 | 2021 Deaths per 100,000 | 2021 Covid Deaths per 100,000 | Increase Overall | Increase "Covid"

75-84 | 4,997.0 | 644.4 | 4,882.6 | 649.3 | -2.29% | 0.76%
85+ | 15210.9 | 1842.9 | 13826.2 | 1395.7 | -9.10% | -24.27%

The CEO of OneAmerica, a $100 billion insurance company, said in January 2021 that the death rate is up 40% from pre-pandemic levels amongst working people. He stated,

> Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three-sigma or a one-in-200 year catastrophe would be a 10% increase over pre-pandemic. So 40% is just unheard of.

If vaccines made us safer, we would expect to see lower deaths in 2021 than in 2020. We would not expect to see massive spikes in the young and healthy, the lowest risk demographic, after an innoculation that is supposed to confer considerable protection from the disease.

## Did COVID-19 really cause all those deaths in the young?

We can't know for sure. There are large financial incentives for hospitals to report deaths as Covid-19 in the United States, through medicare payments, but no studies have conducted to determine whether this has actually resulted in the recording of other-cause deaths as Covid. <sub>[5](#references)</sub> As Dead Man Talking Writes when examining a similar rise in young deaths in Germany,

> The age-dependent pattern contrasts with the risk profile for COVID-19 disease, so an explanation by COVID-related factors seems unlikely. Other possible explanations such as postponed surgery or long-COVID effects are also implausible, because such effects would have to affect also and especially the older age groups.

The death rate spikes in Germany correlate with the roll-outs of the initial vaccination campaign and the booster campaign in the fall.

If these are in fact all COVID deaths, and not due strictly to vaccine side effects, pathogenic priming may play a role. Considerable evidence worldwide suggests negative vaccine effectiveness. This may be due to ADE or pathogenic priming which make the innoculated more susceptible to COVID. See the further reading section for more details.

At the very least we can say that the vaccines have done nothing to reduce overall mortality, and mandating them for students is not justified.

### Further Reading

Subremanian and Kumar's peer-reviewed study shows that there is actually a positive correlation between vaccination rates and COVID-19 cases. <sub>[7](#references)</sub>

The cause may be Pathogenic Priming that increases the severity of the disease post-vaccination, according to an article by James Lyons-Weiler published in the Journal of Translational Immunity in 2020. <sub>[8](#references)</sub>

An article from Steve Kirsch discusses a preprint article that shows negative vaccine effectiveness. While the paper concludes that vaccine rollouts are necessary and great, the data they present show negative effectiveness after 90 days. <sub>[9](#references)</sub>

An article in The Lancet discusses how 89% of New UK COVID cases are among the fully vaxed. <sub>[10](#references)</sub>

A big data analysis on vaccine data, still being peer-reviewed on ResearchGate. <sub>[11](#references)</sub>

Additional evidence exists which I may post in a future article.

**PennWest should not be recommending vaccines to students.**
